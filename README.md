# Resources Xchange

A platform that helps people all over the world to learn skills in a new way. :earth_americas: You can find skill owners and their skills to have an exchange with yours. :boom:



## Motivation

The original ideal was inspired by the resources exchange or barters exsisted in the community(eg, The Time Doners), which makes me wonder if we bring it online and benifit more people who want to learn new skills.
