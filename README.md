# Resources Xchange

It is a platform that introduces a new way of learning skills. :earth_americas: You can find skills that you are interested in and request a learning exchange with your current skills. :boom:

This website allows you to browse and search skills, find skill-owners around you, request Xchange sessions and review your learning experience.


## Motivation

The original ideal was inspired by the resources exchange or barters exsisted in the community(eg, The Time Doners), which makes me wonder if we bring it online and benifit more people who want to learn new skills.
